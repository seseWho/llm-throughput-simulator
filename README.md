# llm-load-mvp

Python MVP project for simulating high-throughput LLM serving behavior.

## Project Goal

This project provides the initial structure for an LLM high-throughput serving simulator. The current goal is to establish a clean backend layout, configuration foundation, placeholder policy and queue components, and minimal API endpoints.

## Architecture Summary

- `backend/`: FastAPI application, API routes, config loading, request and response models.
- `backend/policies/`: placeholders for rate limiting, quota, cost, and policy logic.
- `backend/queue/`: placeholders for admission control, priority scheduling, and queue management.
- `backend/llm_backends/`: placeholders for simulated and Ollama-backed LLM providers.
- `backend/metrics/`: placeholder metrics collection.
- `stress_tester/`: placeholders for future load generation, scenarios, and reporting.
- `config/`: YAML configuration for users, projects, models, limits, and degradation levels.
- `tests/`: minimal tests for the configuration loader.

## Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

## Run the FastAPI Backend

```bash
uvicorn backend.main:app --reload
```

The health endpoint is available at:

```text
GET /health
```

## Current Status

Basic structure only. Full serving, queueing, policy, quota, backend, and stress testing logic has not been implemented yet.

## Future Steps

1. implement config validation
2. implement simulated backend
3. implement rate limiter
4. implement quota manager
5. implement priority queue
6. implement stress tester
7. integrate Ollama
